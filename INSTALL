This Makefile (and software) is GNU/Linux-centric.
To build and install,

 > make realclean
 > make all
 > make test (only a bit there now)
 > make INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/joeuser/local install

The default INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr/local.
You may need to set variables in Makefile.

Files will be installed in
 $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/bin
 $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/include
 $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/lib
